# bf-beeper

This is a small beeper board, which is designed to find a lost model aircraft.
It functions pretty much identical to the other commercial beepers.
The main feature is the ability to deactivate the beeper using Betaflight.

Just activate the normal beeper function of Betaflight and pull the battery.
Since the manual beep pattern is unique all other beep sources won't trigger the disarm.
